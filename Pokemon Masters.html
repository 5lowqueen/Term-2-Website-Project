 <h1>Pokemon Masters</h1> 
 
 <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Pokemon Masters is a mobile Pokemon game released on August 29 2019 for Android and IOS devices. Using the different battling mechanics, the player is able to do 3-on-3 battles, with many different 'Sync Pairs'. A Sync Pair is a Pokemon and trainer duo, like Kris and Totodile. The main character starts off with a Pikachu, but later on, the main character will form much better pairs with different Pokemon. The main goal of the game is to become Pasio's(an artificial island, which is completely man-made) Champion, by defeating the Pokemon Master's League. In order to compete, the player must have all five Badges.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>There are three roles: Strikers(Physical or Special), Support, or Tech. Strikers are the best to attack, Supports are tanky and they help increase allies stats, and Techs are meant to cripple(poison, paralyze,ecetra) the opponent. The player is able to control their three sync pairs, as they try to battle the opponents. There are limited time events, for example, Giovanni and Mewtwo, or the most recent one, "The Strongest There Is", which is a story line(in which I cannot spoil it). The most basic way to obtain Sync Paris, is through the story mode, or through scouting(Gacha), using the in game currency. There is single player mode, and co-op mode, both modes are self explanitory. The best team would be a Support sandwich, with two Supports, and one Striker.</p>

<h2>Personal Connections</h2>
<p>I have been playing this game from its release. I love this game, because you can do 3-on-3 battels, unlike the traditional battling style. However, this game has its own flaws, and the flaw is...(*Drumroll*), the game mechanics! I have to farm for everything to unlock a certain character's level cap. The graphics are on point, every game has its bugs, and Pokemon Masters gives us bug compensations of gems or items. I like how DeNA and the Pokemon Company incorperated many throw back characters. I also like how DeNA pumps out new events and characters to use, as it gets even more hype!</p>
