<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>There are three roles: Strikers(Physical or Special), Support, or Tech. Strikers are the best to attack, Supports are the best for their defensive stats, buffs, and also, healing, and Techs are meant to cripple(poison, paralyze, ecetera) the opponent. The player is able to control their three sync pairs, as they try to battle the opponents. There are limited time events. For example, Giovanni and Mewtwo, or the most recent one, "The Strongest There Is", which is a story line(in which I cannot spoil it). The most basic way to obtain Sync Paris is through the story mode, or through scouting(Gacha), using the in game currency, gems. There is single player mode, and co-op mode in which both modes are self explanitory. The best team would be a Support sandwich, with two Supports, and one Striker (A/N: Which always worked for me UwU, depends on your own preference).</p>
