<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Pokemon Masters is a mobile Pokemon game released on August 29 2019 for Android and IOS devices. Using the different battling mechanics, the player is able to do 3-on-3 battles, with many different 'Sync Pairs'. A 'Sync Pair', is a Pokemon and Trainer duo, for example, Kris and Totodile. The main character starts off with a Pikachu, but later on, the MC will form much better pairs with different Pokemon. The main goal of the game is to become Pasio's(an artificial island, which is completely man-made) Champion, by defeating the Pokemon Master's League (or the PML for short). In order to compete in the PML, the player(MC) must have all five Badges, given by the PML Leaders through out the Main Story. The villainous team, Team Break is known for stealing other people's Pokemon, (A/N:And there's always a problem, until it gets annoying -_-). Their leader is still a mystery, so the players don't know where the members get their masks(A/N: I've seen them wear the masks, and they don't come off >_<).</p>
