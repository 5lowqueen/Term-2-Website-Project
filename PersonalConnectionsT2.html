<p> I love this game, because you can do 3-on-3 battles, unlike the traditional battling style, where you are limited to single or double battles. However, this game has its own flaws, and the flaw is...(*Drumroll*), the game style! I have to farm for everything to unlock a certain character's level cap or moves. The graphics are on point though,  but every game has its bugs, and Pokemon Masters gives us bug compensations of gems or items as compensations. I like how DeNA and the Pokemon Company incorperated manythrow back characters from the main series. I also like how DeNA pumps out new events and characters to use, as it gets even more hype! Also, the design team normally gives us hints about what's going to happen, but mainly, the datamines get leaked, and we've already been spoiled T_T.</p>
